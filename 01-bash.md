Some commands in the terminal:

```bash
cd folder-name # change to subdirectory
cd .. # navigates to the parent directory
cd ~ # navigates to the home directory
cd /is/an/absolute/path
```

In MacOS you can drag the file to the terminal to obtain its absolute path.

More commands:

```bash
ls # lists all files 
ls -a # lists everything including hidden files
mkdir folder-name # makes folder-name
rm file-name # removes file-name
```

To launch a server, navigate to the directory from which you'd like to serve the file and execute the following php command:

```bash
php -S localhost:8888
```
